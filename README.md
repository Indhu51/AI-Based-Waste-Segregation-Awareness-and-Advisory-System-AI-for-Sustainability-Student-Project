The AI-Based Waste Segregation Awareness and Advisory System is an AI for Sustainability student project developed under the 1M1B – IBM SkillsBuild AI + Sustainability Virtual Internship (AICTE). The primary objective of this project is to address the growing challenge of improper waste segregation, which is a major contributor to environmental pollution, landfill overflow, and inefficient recycling processes. A lack of awareness at the individual and community levels often results in recyclable and biodegradable waste being mixed with hazardous and non-recyclable materials, causing long-term environmental damage.

This project presents a web-based AI advisory system designed to educate users and promote correct waste segregation practices. The system helps users understand how to separate waste into appropriate categories such as biodegradable (wet waste), recyclable (dry waste), hazardous waste, reject waste, and e-waste. By providing clear and actionable disposal instructions, the system encourages responsible consumption and supports sustainable waste management practices at the grassroots level.

The solution is implemented as a simple, modular, and beginner-friendly web application, making it accessible to a wide range of users. The system architecture consists of three key layers: a responsive frontend interface, an AI logic layer, and an advisory output layer. The frontend provides a clean and eco-friendly user experience that works seamlessly across mobile and desktop devices. The AI logic layer uses rule-based classification, prompt engineering, and a conceptual Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach supported by a curated waste knowledge base to determine the correct waste category and disposal method. The advisory output layer presents explainable and easy-to-understand recommendations to users.

The project follows Responsible AI principles, ensuring fairness, transparency, ethical behavior, and user privacy. The system does not collect or store any personal data, and all recommendations are designed to be safe, unbiased, and environmentally responsible. This approach builds trust while demonstrating ethical AI usage.

The project aligns strongly with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and also contributes to SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). The anticipated impact includes improved waste segregation awareness, increased recycling and composting rates, reduced landfill waste, and cleaner communities.

Currently, the system functions as a demo-based AI advisory platform focused on education and awareness. Future enhancements may include image-based waste recognition, mobile application deployment, voice-enabled AI assistance, integration with smart waste bins, and city-level waste analytics to further strengthen sustainable waste management efforts.
